##Code for Chapter 7: Systems Dynamic Models

This repository contains code examples for the systems dynamic models discussed in Chapter 7 of *Systems Science and Population Health*.

**Contents**

- Deterministic_SIR.R: Sample code for the numerical integration and graphing of a deterministic SIR model in R.
- Deterministic_SIR.py: Sample code for the numerical integration and graphing of a deterministic SIR model in Python 2.7.

**Requirements**

- R: The R implementation of the SIR model requires the deSolve package.
- Python: The Python implementation of the SIR model requires Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. These are most easily obtained from either the [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) or [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) Python distributions.
